# Cool Paper Beautifier

This is a Chrome extension designed to **beautify** the [Cool Paper](https://papers.cool/) website. Cool Paper aggregates daily new arXiv papers and conference papers.

## âœ¨ Features

-   **Redesigns** the website with a more modern **style**.
-   **Modifies** the PDF reader logic. The PDF **button** now first **tries** to use your browser's **native** PDF reader, as I prefer to use the Google Scholar PDF Reader.
-   **Enhanced arXiv Navigation**: Clicking an arXiv paper's title now directly redirects to its arXiv abstract page.
